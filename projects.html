                        <p class="subtext">About the Northwind sample database
                            The Northwind database is a sample database that was originally created by Microsoft and used as the basis for their tutorials in a variety of database products for decades. The Northwind database contains the sales data for a fictitious company called “Northwind Traders,” which imports and exports specialty foods from around the world. The Northwind database is an excellent tutorial schema for a small-business ERP, with customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, employees, and single-entry accounting. The Northwind database has since been ported to a variety of non-Microsoft databases, including PostgreSQL.
                            
                            The Northwind dataset includes sample data for the following.
                            
                            Suppliers: Suppliers and vendors of Northwind
                            Customers: Customers who buy products from Northwind
                            Employees: Employee details of Northwind traders
                            Products: Product information
                            Shippers: The details of the shippers who ship the products from the traders to the end-customers
                            Orders and Order_Details: Sales Order transactions taking place between the customers & the company
